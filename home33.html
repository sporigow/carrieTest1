                    "I had a SUPERB experience with Barry Belenke. He was so sensitive to the fact that I was using my late Grandmother’s diamond and took excellent care of me. I could text/call at any time and get an answer or if he missed it there would be a fast call or text back. I had to move up my due date by TWO MONTHS and it was a very short notice and he quickly took care of me. Ted, Matt, Barry and the other employees are excellent craftsmen and it is a wonderful family business. Would give more stars if I could. Thank you!!!"<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Graham C

                    "This place and these people are a true pleasure to work with. Ted designed and made a ring for my wife that is simply gorgeous. Barry has helped with multiple repairs of some family heirlooms and I have nothing but praise for the work and integrity these folks have. Highly recommend and they are my go to for all our jewelry and watch needs."<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Yehoshua C

                    "Wow, such a cool place. Old school customer service, where the owners meet you at the door and shake your hand like they've known you forever. Just stopped by after finding them on Google maps. They have a fantastic collection of vintage and new jewelry. I'll admit I was a bit apprehensive on entering and being disappointed by either the selection or customer service. I'm happy to say I couldn't have been further off track. Barry met us at the door with a smile and warm welcome. Ted and Matt were happy to say hello and also welcome my wife and I to their shop. The selection is really amazing, vintage jewelry some dating back to the 19th century. Not into "old" jewelry they have new creations from themselves or can easily make your own design or dream come true. The only problem is I didn't have enough money to clean them out. So many great pieces. My wife found a fantastic ring she loves very much for her 50th birthday. The prices are super reasonable. We saw items from $39 to $13k. I'm going back soon to have an heirloom cleaned, and resized for me. Local owners= local economic growth."<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Jerome M

                    "Barry is the man. My fiancé and I just had a wonderful experience in this store. The entire experience was fun, unassuming, and unpretentious. Barry and the crew are proud of their work, and very knowledgeable. Knowledge and caring is apparent when describing the history and make up of each piece. The eclectic and thoughtful spread and depth of their wares shows passion, creativity, and an experienced eye. There is something for everyone in this shop. And something at every price point too. This is also a full-service shop. Cleaning, repair, crafting and more are all on premises, and the shop looks well cared for and neat. Details are preeminent here, and that is something very important to me and my lady. Thank you, fellas, we will be back!"<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Jason V
